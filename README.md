# Code Checker

A street fighter themed, gameified code analyzer.

This was one of my first projects I did when I first started to code. Please look at it and share my horror. It works but is unfinished. Ideally I would like to add music and some actual code analysis!

## Installation

1. git clone && cd
1. `bundle`
1. `bundle exec rackup`
1. in another session, `compass watch`
